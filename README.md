Developing Data Products Project - Dataset Explore Tool
=========================================================================

This shiny App is for exploring an existing dataset with linear regression model, plot, summary.
The default dataset is just used for test. 
Here I provided a dataset called AmesHousePrice.csv in the github remote repo. 
Please download the csv dataset from my shared repo. Thanks.
